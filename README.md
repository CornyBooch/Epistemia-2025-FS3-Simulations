Hello. This is a demonstration of our Simulation Code that has bene submitted for Epistemia 2025. 

There are two models in this code, a Growth Model and a Decay Model.

The Growth Model is a simulation of the growth of microbes, in the condition you'd like, and the Decay model is a
simulation of the Death of microbes, in the condition you'd like. 

We have taken values of 5 , 10 in our system, and 30 , 35 in a standard forensic grade refrigerator.

Before using the simulation code, be sure to change the parameters.
